_It's no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then._

Don't get stuck here. Always keep moving forward. Let's learn japanese.

## What you need

This guide assumes that you know the hiragana and katakana and that you're studying basic japanese vocabulary. The most efficient way to learn the kana (hiragana+katakana) is to drill it through brute force. You can use [DJT Kana](https://djtguide.neocities.org/kana/index.html) for this. You can also learn by exposure. I did both.

This guide assumes that you know what writing systems japanese uses, and that you know what japanese text looks like, and what Kanji are.

This guide assumes that you're learning vocabulary outside this guide. I can't teach you enough words to be useful without getting in the way of the grammar.

If you need more guidance for things other than grammar, try the [DJT Guide](https://djtguide.neocities.org/guide.html).

**Check this:** 置 How does this character render? If it's missing the vertical line on the left side, your browser is using chinese fonts for japanese. You may need to install japanese fonts or change some system language settings.

## How to use this guide and Learn Japanese

Basically, this guide is a primer. This guide takes a very specific stance: The only way to _acquire_ language features and become fluent is to consume them in a real context. This guide doesn't try to drill you, and that's a good thing.

When you read this guide, don't try to memorize it. It won't work.

You shouldn't spend a week on each lesson. In fact, I think one new lesson a day is far too slow, even if you're also reviewing old lessons.

Every single main lesson in this guide covers basic grammar. You should read the entire thing as quickly as possible. It's important to get stuff in your head sooner rather than later. It gives it time to grow, subconsciously, and even if you didn't feel like you learned it the first time, it makes it easier to remember it for good next time. Just don't get stuck reviewing it forever.

After you get far enough in this guide, you should start trying to read.

Trying to read on a regular basis, even if you can't do it for more than five minutes, tells you **exactly** what your weak points are, and gives you a sense of progress. This guide exposes you to grammar to let you parse things, but you need to consume real japanese to turn that exposure into acquisition.

The most efficient way to learn vocabulary is to start picking up words from media you enjoy, then memorize them with flashcards. This is called mining. Anki is the recommended flashcard program because it uses Spaced Repetition, which shows you stuff less often the better you know it. You can use frequency lists or shared decks prepared by other people if you don't want to mine.

If you want to speak japanese, you **must** consume audible spoken japanese, otherwise you'll sound unnatural. It doesn't matter if it's anime or news or living in japan, you just have to consume it in the spoken unwritten form. This can come after you learn how to read, but you should passively expose yourself to it (with anything: VNs, music, anime, etc) as early as possible, otherwise it'll take a long time for your brain to pick up on nuanced sound differences, like how japanese people need to be trained before they can tell apart L and R.

## "Help!"

All I can say is don't sweat it. Try to find a way to use this guide in a nice low stress way. Don't angst out about something being hard. Some things just take time.

If you still don't know what to do, or you came back here confused:

-   Start learning the hiragana and katakana outside this guide.
-   Start studying vocabulary outside this guide.
-   Don't think that kanji are words, that makes everything confusing.
-   Remind yourself that japanese is not similar to english word-by-word.
-   A lot of concepts will not make sense in terms of literal english.
-   You can't acquire a language without consuming it.
-   Until you read enough, some things just won't click.
-   Always keep moving forward. That's what gives you the language.

Do not memorize this guide. It won't work. It might even be bad for you.
