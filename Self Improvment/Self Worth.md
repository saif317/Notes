while society may convince you that you are only as valuable as what you can _do_, that is quite frankly **a lie**.

We are, all of us, complicated, multifaceted beings, and worth is inherent in us. It is not for others to bestow that worthiness upon us, nor is it for us to question it of ourselves. **But you will feel tempted to do so continuously throughout your life**.

This may be something you understand on a logical level, but believing it is a life-long task you will need to work at constantly.

**Doing something badly does not define who you are**. It doesn't say anything about you as a person, and it is not the basis upon which you can reasonably be judged.
