# Beginners: 10 Things I Wish Someone Had Told Me …

Some things to know for those who ask, “I’ve always wanted to draw. I’d like to learn now. Is there anything I should know?” This deals with drawing, but can translate into any art making discipline. And of course, these are just my opinions, others will have different experiences and advice.

Here's my 10 things:

1.) Drawing, especially learning, isn’t as easy as it seems. If you are frustrated because you aren’t getting better, you are A.) under-estimating the difficulty of the discipline and/or B.) over-estimating your ability.

2.) No one begins by drawing well. No one is born able to draw well. Every artist who draws proficiently has endured years and years of bad drawings. No exceptions.

3.) No comparing. The artist you compare your work to, has been drawing for many years, sometimes for as long as they can remember. They made their mistakes when they were young children. Children don’t care about mistakes – they just like making pictures and coloring them.

4.) You will get frustrated. Art is just as much about overcoming fear and failure as it is about technique. That’s why art is effective in therapy. People who continue to learn to draw find the pain of stopping greater than the pain of learning.

5.) Art making is just as much about training your eye and mind. An untrained eye is not able to see the values in a shadow or the negative space in a figure; the untrained mind will not be disciplined to process the information to help the hand reproduce these images correctly. The eye and mind are trained by time spent drawing. (Even when given solid advice, you may be too artistically immature to hear it.)

6.) The training (item #5) only comes from time drawing and failing. Tips and tricks will solve the drawing in front of you, but will not give you the skills to avoid or overcome that problem in your next drawing, and the next, and the next, etc., etc. Critiques will help you recognize mistakes, but the skill only comes with failures, errors and more practice.

7.) Dissociate to reconnect. By disconnecting with the object, you are free to reproduce what you actually see, and not the preconceived construct of what your mind already knows about the object. This is why beginners are told to turn photo references upside down.

8.) Stop saying I suck. It’s not endearing, humble or beneficial. Putting yourself (and your work) down subconsciously sabotages your self worth and self esteem. You’ll need those. No “Yeah, but …” We all sucked at first, your not special. Which brings me to your “inner editor”.

9.) Your inner editor, is your worst enemy. It knows you better than you do and is always looking for the easy route. It will effectively humiliate you so you can spend more time playing video games than you do practicing drawing characters from them.

10.) Time. Learning to draw takes time, the less time you give it, the longer it will be before you ever get good. We each have the same amount of time in our day. With exceptions of school and work, how we choose to spend it is mostly our decision. Bottom line: if you spend more time: watching TV, playing video games, on the computer or hanging out with friends, than you do practicing your drawing, you will not get better at drawing.

Time plus hard work always equals results. Please feel free to add your own. It may help and encourage a beginner.

EDIT:

11.) Drawing from imagination is a _highly advanced skill_. The best way to learn to draw from imagination is to _keep drawing from life and photos_. When advanced artists draw from memory, they still use elements of reality. Fantasy and traditional artists hire models and use real animals as references; sculptures (and painters too) make a maquette to visualize their scenes, etc., etc.

“You cannot draw what you cannot see.” – Leonardo da Vinci

EDIT ll:

12.) People love rules. People love to force their self-imposed rules on you and your art. (Not surprisingly, their rigid system of rules is based on the way they make their art.) This person loves debate and critiques; they are contrary and vocal. Don't let them rent space in your head.
