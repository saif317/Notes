More on "for" Loops

"for" Loops are an important language feature in many programming languages - the same is true for Dart.

You learned about this syntax:

1.  for (var i = 0; i < recentTransactions.length; i++) {
2.   print(recentTransactions[i]); // access list items with [i] => i is dynamic!
3.  }

Looping through a list (to then do something with each list item) is such a common case, that Dart actually has a different kind of "for" loop as well:

1.  for (var tx in recentTransactions) {
2.   print(tx); // tx is the item already! Changes with every iteration of course
3.  }

It's of course up to you which approach you use - you should definitely be aware of both approaches, also because some programming languages only offer approach #1 and not approach #2.
